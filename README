"Terms of Service"
------------------

The seed or "cipher" used in the algorithm in this package to generate
 the checkhash needed for each query is as follows:

	"Mining PageRank is AGAINST GOOGLE'S TERMS OF SERVICE. Yes, I'm talking to you, scammer."

The above sentance is used to generate the checkhash and is only included
 for that reason.

To my knowledge Google's "Terms Of Service" does not cover or mention
 "Mining" or "PageRank".

However, in the infamous words of Google: "Don't be evil".
